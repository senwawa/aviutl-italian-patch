# aviutl-italian-patch
Italian translation for AviUtl. The files were not originally mine; I just took them from another repository and then modified and translated them. 

Original Repository: https://github.com/sykhro/aviutl-english-patch 

Please note that I am still translating the entire file, it will take some time, so please be patient.

## compila.bat
**Keep in mind that this file is in Italian, i will make an English version eventually**

For people that don't speak Italian, this is a file to compile the .rc file.

To use **compila.bat**, you must first modify it: 
You need to replace all the "**Rimpiazzami**" with actual paths.
